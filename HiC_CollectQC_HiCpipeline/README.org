* Main
Collect qc from the output of hic pipeline. After hic maps are created, statistics is saved to inter.txt and inter_30.txt files.
The objective of this script is to loop over sample directories to collect metadata, clean and parse it into a usable table.

Each directory's name will be used as sample name in the table.

** Key Differences Between `inter.hic` and `inter_30.hic` in Juicer

- **inter.hic**
  - Contains all inter-chromosomal Hi-C contacts.
  - Includes contacts regardless of mapping quality (MAPQ).
  - Useful for comprehensive analysis, but includes lower-confidence alignments.

- **inter_30.hic**
  - Contains only inter-chromosomal contacts with MAPQ â‰¥ 30 for both read pairs.
  - Filters out lower-confidence alignments.
  - More suitable for high-confidence analysis and downstream processing.

* Usage:

** Installation
#+begin_src bash
  micromamba/mamba/conda create -n <name> -f env.yml
  micromamba/mamba/conda activate <name>
  chmod +x Collect_inter-Stats.sh make_barplt.py
#+end_src

** Run
