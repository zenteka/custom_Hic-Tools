This tool adds gene annotattion to bins. Since columns of bg2 are
2xbed3, we separate Bin1 locus information and Bin2 locus to anotate
each separately. We append two columns of gene commma separated lists
as columns.

Import dump output might different between tools and/or parameters. Make
sure your output is in bg2 format. That is: colmuns 1-3 are chrom start
end of Bin1 and columns 4-6 are chrom start end of bin2.

* Installation

Clone or simply copy Dump_AddGeneAnnotation.sh.

* Useage 
#+begin_src bash
  chmod +x ./Dump_AddGeneAnnotation.sh
  ./Dump_AddGeneAnnotation.sh -i [ Path to dump file] \
                              -a [ Path to gene annotation in bed format]
#+end_src
