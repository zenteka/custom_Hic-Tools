#+Title: Custom Hi-C scripts.

* Main

** Descritpion
This repository is a collection of scripts that I wrote in the course
of data analysis. This repository is NOT a package or complete
analysis, it exists merely to foster collaborative work. You can use
the scripts freely as they are or modify them but please be mindful that
the goal of this repository is to share code that sometimes can be unfinished and therefore less robust.

** Content
Each directory contains a separate, standalone script(s). What they all have in common, is that they can be used from a command line.
In each directory you will find README file with the useage description.
